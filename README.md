I recently completed an automated testing project using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **TestNG** to simulate real-world testing scenarios on web applications.

ðŸ§ª **Key Features:**

* Automated login validation
* Form submission testing
* Page navigation verification
* Title & URL assertions
* Screenshot capture on test failure
* Follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern
* Organized using **Maven** for clean structure and dependency management
